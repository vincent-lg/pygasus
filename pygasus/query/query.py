class Query:

    """
    Class representing a query.

    The query syntax is meant to remain close (but not equivalent) to Python, using standard operators whenever possible  or methods whenever appropriate.  Queries can easily be chained as well.

        print(Person.first_name == "John"))

    ... or:

        print(Person.first_name.lower() == "john"))

    ... or:

        print(Person.select)Person.age <= 25))

    A field is a query, so using `Person.name` is already a query in itself that `Person.select` will accept.  However, queries can be nested, which makes them much more interesting.

    Supported operators:

        ==: quality, no matter the field type.

    Supported methods:

        contains: on string fields, check whether a substring is in a string.
        lower(): on string fields, return the lowercase string.

    """

    def __init__(self, operation, arguments=None):
        self.operation = operation
        self.arguments = arguments or (self, )

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return Query(Binary.EQUAL, arguments=(self, other))

    def contains(self, other):
        """
        Check whether a substring is contained in this parent string.

        Args:
            substring (str): the substring to test.

        Usually, this function is called on a field:

            Person.name.contains("ab")

        ... which will only return True if the field contains "ab".
        Of course, you can also combine it:

            Person.name.lower().contains("ab")

        ... will do the same, but the case will be ignored.

        """
        return Query(Function.CONTAINS, arguments=(self, other))

    def lower(self):
        """
        Return the lowercase string.

        Args:
            None.

        This method, called on a field, will return the lowercase version
        of this field.  Accented letters (NON-ASCII letters) will
        be lowercased if possible (`str.lower` is used, not the default
        `LOWER` function provided in Sqlite).  Of course, keep in mind
        such an operation can be costly, if you have 1 million rows
        in a table and ask to lowercase all text entries to select,
        but this method has been optimized.

            Person.select(Person.name.lower() == "john")

        """
        return Query(Function.LOWER, arguments=(self, ))
